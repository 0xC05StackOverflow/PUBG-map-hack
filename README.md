# PUBG-map-hack

This is just my little map hack that I was using for some 300+ hours with no bans whatsoever from BE. I must say BE is pretty uncompetent AC after all, if you just keep yourself at the ring0.

I will update this repo as actively as I can.

# Changelog

* 10.10.2017 Added kernel driver code. It should work out the box. I used VS2015 and its KMDF tools to dev / compile it.

* 9.10.2017 Added the usermode app barebones. It does not work or compile yet. I will need to work on it for some more hours first.
